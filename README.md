## Inspiration
This game was inspired by "A Dark Room" for iOS, adapted to the modern world. 

## What it does
It's supposed to be a game! Since it's not deployed (see Challenges section), I'll describe it here! The idea is that there are two paths in the game. The first path is the conventional work work work, earn money writing BS code, eventually do work as a search engine startup and hire frontend/backend/optimization engineers, get users, and monetize on them! Users don't like that, and the game ends when eventually all money is gone, loans are due, and the player has zero users to monetize. 

The game gives a hint after losing, to try it again but without going to "work". So that means the only option is to code, code code. After enough coding, get a contributor which implies open source and contributors keep coming, after which you can contribute to Blockstack, Ethereum and Bitcoin. The game ends after contributing to Bitcoin...with a *shocking*, underwhelming ending.

## How I built it
One day at a time. Reading the intro to react tutorial was very helpful...I am very new at this.

## Challenges I ran into
Time. I wanted to do so much...but had so little time.
Unfamiliarity with the programming language meant building this game was a little difficult.
I even finished the game, and have screenshots etc...but it turns out deploying it was a giant mess. 
I kept getting an error "Super expression must either be null or a function" only AFTER deploying it to my github.io site. I finally tracked it down to the AwesomeButton component, which didn't seem to work when deployed. So unfortunately I don't have anything to show except for screenshots from my development version.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I built my first game! I learned that deploying can be difficult.

## What I learned
Javascript. React. How to make a game!

## What's next for A Dark Screen
Depth! The current iteration has none of the complexity of the original game.
